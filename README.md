# gede

GEDE is kind of an artistic name for me, Gabriel Vinazza (Buenos Aires, Argentina).  I do synthesis, audiovisual projects, theoretical works and livecoding (mainly in Pure Data). Here I'll updload some things I've been working for more than ten years but weren't much connected with the outside-online world. Hope it will inspire or be helpfull in some way.
