# This is OI (One Input) project,
## something I made mainly for livecoding with Pure Data inspired by bytebeat, using just logical/math expressions with expr~.
### Here you'll find example patches and documentation. Soon I'll upload a OI generative patch and maybe a graphical/interactive interface.
